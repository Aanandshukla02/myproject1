            Chanakya, also known as <b> Kautilya or Vishnugupta </b>, was an
            ancient Indian philosopher, economist, strategist, and political
            advisor who lived in the 4th century BCE. He is best known as the
            author of the Arthashastra, an influential treatise on statecraft,
            economics, and political strategy. Chanakya was born in the ancient
            city of Taxila (in present-day Pakistan) and was a disciple of the
            great philosopher and teacher, Chanakya. He played a crucial role in
            the rise of the Mauryan Empire, serving as the chief advisor to
            Chandragupta Maurya, the founder of the empire. Chanakya's
            strategies and tactics were instrumental in defeating the powerful
            Nanda Empire and consolidating the Mauryan Empire. Chanakya was a
            great proponent of realpolitik, the idea that politics should be
            based on practical considerations rather than moral or ideological
            principles. He believed that a ruler should do whatever it takes to
            protect and expand his power, even if it meant using deceit,
            manipulation, or violence. Apart from the Arthashastra, Chanakya is
            also credited with composing the Chanakya Niti, a collection of
            aphorisms on life and governance. His teachings continue to be
            studied and admired by scholars and politicians to this day, and he
            is regarded as one of the greatest thinkers in Indian history.
